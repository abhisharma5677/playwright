Fixture :- In Playwright, fixtures are used to set up and tear down test environments, such as launching browsers,
           creating pages, and performing any necessary cleanup after the tests have run. There are two types of 
           fixtures based on their scope: session scope and function scope.



Session Scope Fixture:-
    1. A session scope fixture is created once per testing session and persists throughout the entire session.
    
    2. It is commonly used for expensive setup operations that you want to perform only once for all tests within a session.
    
    3. Examples of operations suitable for a session scope fixture include launching a browser instance, setting up 
       authentication, or preparing test data.
    
    4. To define a session scope fixture in Playwright, you can use the beforeAll and afterAll hooks provided by testing 
       frameworks like Jest or Mocha. These hooks allow you to set up and tear down resources before and after the entire 
       test suite runs.




Function Scope Fixture:-
    1. A function scope fixture is created and torn down for each individual test function.
    
    2. It is commonly used for setting up and tearing down resources that need to be isolated between test cases.
    
    3. Examples of operations suitable for a function scope fixture include creating a new page instance, navigating
       to a specific URL, or clearing cookies before each test.
    
    4. To define a function scope fixture in Playwright, you can use the beforeEach and afterEach hooks provided by 
       testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha. These hooks allow you to set up and tear down resources before and after
       each test function runs.
