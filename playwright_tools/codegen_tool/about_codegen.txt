           for common actions you might perform in your tests. This tool is called Playwright CLI.

           scripts based on those interactions.

as you normally would, performing actions such as clicking buttons, typing into input fields, or 
navigating to different pages.



Generate code snippets:-
After you're done interacting with the webpage, close the browser window. Playwright CLI will generate
code snippets based on the interactions you performed and output them to the terminal.


Copy and use the generated code:-
Playwright CLI will display code snippets in various programming languages (JavaScript, Python, and more)
that you can use in your tests. Copy the code snippets relevant to your test scenario and incorporate them
into your test scripts.
